# Notes of Shared Data File and Code

## Notes of Data File

In our study "Neuronal representation of visual working memory content in the primate primary visual cortex," we have consolidated the data presented in the main text and supplementary materials into a MATLAB-readable .mat file named "Figure_data." By simply loading this file, readers can access the data associated with all figures in the paper. We share this dataset for the convenience of our readers here.

## Notes of Code for Data Visualization

To ensure that the shared dataset is clear and comprehensible, we have provided a unified plotting script called "Figure.m." This script can be directly executed in the MATLAB environment. First, readers need to load the .mat file "Figure_data" mentioned earlier into MATLAB's workspace. Next, by adding this script to MATLAB's path, it can be run directly. The script will generate a total of 29 figures. We have made efforts to enable readers to easily and quickly understand which dataset corresponds to the data related to each experiment through these figures.

We have employed a more compatible MATLAB plotting code in this section. As a result, the graphical layout may differ from what is presented in our article. However, the data source and content are strictly consistent between the two.
